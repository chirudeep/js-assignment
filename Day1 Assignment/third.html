	<h1>Javascript Data Types</h1>
	<h3>Javascript variables can hold many data types some are: numbers, strings, objects, boolean, null, undefined</h3>
	<h2>Numbers</h2>
	<p>JavaScript has only one type of numbers.<br>
	Numbers can be written with, or without decimals</p>
	<h2>Strings</h2>
	<p>JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it.</p>
	<h2>Objects</h2>
	<p>In Javascript an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier.<br>
	JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.<br>
	Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
	</p>
	<h2>null</h2>
	<p>The Null type has exactly one value: null.</p>
	<h2>Boolean</h2>
	<p>Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false. </p>
	<h2>Undefined</h2>
	<p>In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.</p>
